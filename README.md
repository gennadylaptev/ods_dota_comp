A model for mlcourse.ai: Dota 2 Winner Prediction.

My model is simple: a single CatBoost model. In order to get submission file, just run "run.py". All data should be placed in "data" directory (https://www.kaggle.com/c/mlcourse-dota2-win-prediction). The submission file "submission.csv" wll be placed in the root directory.
